# Printing is easy, all you do is type print, then put what you want to print in doube quotes and parenthesis -> print ("like this")

print ("Question 1: ")
# leave only the correct answer
print ("What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program?")
print ("An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.")
print ("An algorithm is limited to mathematical operation, a program can specify all kinds of operations.")
print ("An algorithm makes a slow program run fast.")
print ("An algorithm deals with computer hardware, a program deals with computer software.")

print ("Question 2: ")
print ("True or False? A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.")
# write the print statement here to print true or false to the screen.

print ("Question 3: ")
print (" True or False? Computer Science is the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs.")
# write the print statement here to print true or false to the screen.

print ("Question 4: ")
print ("The two things every computer can do are: ")
# leave only the correct two answers
print ("Perform calculations, Convert electricity to numbers, Display results to a screen, Remember the results")

print ("Question 5: ")
print ("True or False? Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.")
# write the print statement here to print true or false to the screen.

print ("Question 6: ")
print ("Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.")
# write the print statement here to print true or false to the screen.

print ("Question 7: ")
print ("True or False? A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.")
# write the print statement here to print true or false to the screen.

print ("Question 8: ")
print ("Ascii art time, observe the following pattern of print statements, can you use the technique below to print an uppercase letter E")
# the letter 'A'
print("    *")
print("   * *")
print("  *****")
print(" *     *")
print("*       *")
print()

print ("Question 9: ")

print ("Question 10: ")
# This question is more of a checklist, print out yes when completed, you can say no to liking python, as long as you do the work (-:
print ("I have completed all of the questions here...")
print ("I have created a Github account")
print ("I have uploaded this script to Github and named it lab1_week1.py ")
print ("I like python")
